# Amnesia
Removes all Vanilla starting research, and as such, is only useful at the start of a new game.

Patches are named after their function. EG: "Vanilla_NewTribeResearch.xml" is the patch that removes all starting tribal research in Vanilla. You can delete a patch if you want the starting research back.

If you'd like more mods to be patched open an issue with a link to the mod, and a description/names of the research you want removed.
